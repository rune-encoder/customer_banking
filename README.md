## Description
This application is a simple customer banking system that allows users to calculate and track interest earned on both their savings and CD (Certificate of Deposit) accounts.  

Users can input their account balance, APR (Annual Percentage Rate), and the number of months for their accounts. The application will then compute the interest earned and the updated balance and display it on the terminal for both types of accounts (Savings Account & CD Account).
